# Test
This is just to build a test web app for a dynamic web application driven data base
I employed no-Sql, mongo DB, as my database.
Though the login and sign up page have  not been styled by CSS (here, employed CSS bootstrap frame work)

I m looking forward to use React the javascript libary or frame work for the Front end
the fornt end i did here is purely javascript with html, Embedded javaScript, having the ejs files
I intend to modified this code so that it can talk with Maps API for the campground areas.
